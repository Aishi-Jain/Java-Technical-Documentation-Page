                    Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation). It is known for its platform independence, robustness, and wide range of applications, from desktop to web and mobile development. This documentation provides an overview of Java, its syntax, features, and best practices for programming in Java.

                    Some computers might have Java already installed.
                    <br>
                    To check if you have Java installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Java or type the following in Command Prompt (cmd.exe):
                    <br>
                    <code>C:\Users\Your Name>java -version</code>
                    <br>
                    If Java is installed, you will see something like this (depending on version):
                    <br>
                    <code>
                        java version "11.0.1" 2018-10-16 LTS
                        Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13-LTS)
                        Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13-LTS, mixed mode)
                    </code>
                    <br>
                    If you do not have Java installed on your computer, you can download it for free at <a href="oracle.com">Oracle</a>.
                </p>
                <h3>Setup for Windows</h3>
                <p>To install java on windows, follow these steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Go to "System Properties" (Can be found on Control Panel > System and Security > System > Advanced System Settings)
                        <img src="/images/step 1.1.png" alt="Step 1.1">
                        <img src="/images/step 1.2.png" alt="Step 1.2">
                        <img src="images/step 1.3.png" alt="Step 1.3">
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Click on the "Environment variables" button under the "Advanced" tab
                        <img src="images/step 2.png" alt="Step 2">
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then, select the "Path" variable in System variables and click on the "Edit" button
                        <img src="images/step 3.png" alt="">
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Click on the "New" button and add the path where Java is installed, followed by <strong>\bin</strong>. 
                        <br>
                        By default, Java is installed in <strong>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1</strong> (If nothing else was specified when you installed it). 
                        <br>
                        In that case, You will have to add a new path with: <strong>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1\bin</strong>
                        <br>
                        Then, click "OK", and save the settings
                        <img src="images/step 4.png" alt="">
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        At last, open Command Prompt (cmd.exe) and type java -version to see if Java is running on your machine
                        <br>
                        Write the following in the command line (cmd.exe):
                        <code>C:\Users\Your Name>java -version</code>
                        If Java was successfully installed, you will see something like this (depending on version):
                        <code>
                            java version "11.0.1" 2018-10-16 LTS
                            Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13-LTS)
                            Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13-LTS, mixed mode)
                        </code>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    If you do not wish to use a notepad, you can use IDEs like IntelliJ and Eclipse. The are more user friendly and do not require you to use the command prompt. The are basically like VS code, except it's only for Java.

                    Java programs are organized into classes, which contain methods and variables.
                    <br>
                    In Java, every application begins with a class name, and that class must match the filename. 
                    <br>
                    Let's create our first Java file, called Main.java, which can be done in any text editor (like Notepad).
                    <br>
                    <code>
                        public class Main {
                            public static void main(String[] args) {
                            System.out.println("Hello World");
                            }
                        }
                    </code>
                    <br>
                    Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. In our example, we named the class Main. A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.
                    <br>
                    The name of the java file must match the class name. When saving the file, save it using the class name and add ".java" to the end of the filename.
                    <br>
                    Once you run the above code, you'll get the following output:
                    <br>
                    <code>Hello World</code>
                </p>
